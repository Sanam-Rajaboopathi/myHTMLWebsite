        <div>Description:</div>
        <p>In late 2000, a young boy in Ahmedabad dreams of owning a business. To accommodate his friends' passion, he opens a cricket shop. However, nothing comes easy in a turbulent city. To realise their goals, they will have to face it all-religious politics,
             calamities, unacceptable love and, above all, their own mistakes.
